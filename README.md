# Python Hangman Game
## Running this game:
```bash
pip3 install pygame
```
Note: you will need Python 3.7 or older to run pygame. If you want to run pygame on Python 3.8, you'll have to install the developer version.

## Technologies used:
- Python Pygame
- Unofficial Google Dictionary API

## Purpose:

This game will have a GUI which the player can use to input a certan letter of the alphabet, the letter will be crossreferenced with the word, and if it correct, the letters will be made visible. Otherwise, the player will have one fewer chance to get the word right. The game will offer three levels of difficulties with completely randomized words

At the end, the player will have the option to view the definition of the word, which will be provided by the unofficial Google Dictionary API.

## Conclusion:
A lot of maths and arrays were used in this project, giving me valuable insight into how to connect seemingly contrasting pieces of code.
