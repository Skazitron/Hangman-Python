# Python Hangman Game

## Technologies used:
- Python Pygame
- Unofficial Google Dictionary API

## Purpose:
This game will have a GUI which the player can use to input a certan letter of the alphabet, the letter will be crossreferenced with the word, and if it correct, the letters will be made visible. Otherwise, the player will have one fewer chance to get the word right. A scoring system will determine the user's scores based on how many consecutive words they get right.

At the end, the player will have the option to view the definition of the word, which will be provided by Oxford's Dictionary API.
